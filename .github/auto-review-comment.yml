        Since you’ve made changes to files in `web/main/` consider these points:

        - Do you need to backport styles changes to `web/public/404.html` or `web/public/500.html`?
        - Think about app loading styles inlined in `index.html`.

      message: |
        Since you changed `core/`:
        - [ ] Think about making types more precise. Can you better explain data relations by type?
        - [ ] Think about conflict resolution. We don’t need some very smart changing merging; just 2 changes of the same item on different clients should not break the database. What if the user changes an item on one machine and removes it on another?
        - [ ] Think about log and storage migration.
