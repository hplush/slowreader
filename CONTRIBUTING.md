## Language

- In the project, we are using **English**.
- Most contributors are _not native speaker_. Don’t be afraid of your language if you are not a native English speaker too.
- Feel free to use _automatic translators_. Use [DeepL to write issues](https://www.deepl.com/translator) and the browser’s translation to read docs.

## Where to Ask Questions

- Don’t know anything and need assistance?
- Have some unknown issue running the project server for development?
- Don’t know how to contribute?

You can ask any question to the maintainer in Telegram: **[`@sitnik`](https://t.me/sitnik)**. You can ask in _English_, _Russian_, or _Spanish_.

> Our mentoring is a basic payback for your time and contribution to the project. Even a simple question can improve the guide for other beginners.

## Install Environment

1. Install environment:

   - The recommended way is to install [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) and then run:

     ```sh
     asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
     asdf plugin-add pnpm https://github.com/jonathanmorley/asdf-pnpm.git
     asdf install
     ```

   - But for one-time work, you can manually install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) versions according to [`.tool-versions`](./.tool-versions) file.

   - For an initial overview and run the project without downloading, you can try the online sandbox on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/hplush/slowreader?file=web/main/main.svelte).

2. Then install all npm dependencies by `pnpm`:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run tests to be sure that everything is OK (open issue if tests don’t work in your environment):

   ```sh
   pnpm test
   ```

## Run Web Client

To run web clients, just call in the root of the project:

```sh
pnpm start
```

It will run a web server and proxy (the website, by default, can make HTTP requests only to its own servers; we need a proxy to send requests to RSS feeds on other servers).

To run the visual testing tool (Storybook), run it from the `web/` folder:

```sh
cd web/
pnpm visual
```

It will show all UI components and all possible states of pages. It is the best tool to test browser compatibility or change CSS.

## Text Editor Settings

To work with the project, we recommend adding to your IDE or text editor:

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin to sync text editor settings. VS Code automatically takes these settings from the `.vscode/` folder.
- Svelte syntax support for Web Client. Like [`svelte.svelte-vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) for VS Code.

You may also install Prettier and ESLint plugins or just use [`precommit` hook](./nano-staged.json).

If you write docs, we recommend installing [LanguageTool](https://dev.languagetool.org/software-that-supports-languagetool-as-a-plug-in-or-add-on.html) for grammar check. For VS Code, [`davidlday.languagetool-linter`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davidlday.languagetool-linter).

## Learn App Architecture

Before any significant changes, read all **[`README.md`](README.md)** to understand app architecture.

## Check Our Checklist

Read our **[checklist for pull requests](./docs/pull_request_template.md)**. It contains things you should think about and can speed up code review a lot.

> If you see that people made the same mistake several times, suggest adding a new item to the checklist to prevent repeating these mistakes.

## How to Find Next Task

If you are not just fixing a bug but want to join the core team, here is the path:

<!--
1. Your first task is to test `pnpm test` in your environment and report issue.
2. Go to our [Tasks plan](https://github.com/orgs/hplush/projects/1) and take next task from `Onboarding` column.
   1. Choose any task that fits the best to you.
   2. Write there `I want to take it`.
   3. The task will be reserved for you for a week.
   4. Don’t worry if a week is not enough. Just make a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
3. After the onboarding, you can take tasks from the `Ready to Take` column. See the discussions in issues to pick next one.
-->

Feel free to ask [maintainer](https://t.me/sitnik) about your next task.

> We will mentor you in return for your participation, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.

## Commits

We care about good commit messages. Try to think about them and describe more:

```diff
- git commit -m 'Fix issue'
+ git commit -m 'Fix <Loader> style in Safari'
```

In commit’s messages example **why** you did changes, **not what** you changed:

```diff
- git commit -m 'Add .editorconfig'
+ git commit -m 'Add .editorconfig to sync text editor settings'
```

We recommend signing [your commits](./docs/onboarding.md#enable-signing-git-commits).
