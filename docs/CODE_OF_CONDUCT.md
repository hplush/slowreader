# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- **Appreciate and accommodate our differences.** Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, personal habits to clothing, attitudes, and beliefs. Respect the way how people ask you to communicate with them.
- **Judge ideas, not people.** Every idea counts for its merit, not who brings it up.
